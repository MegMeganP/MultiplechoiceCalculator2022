        <h2>About</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Would you like your kids to improve their ability to rapidly do arithmetic?  
                Would you like a way to stay sharp?  
                Would you like to keep the comforts of calculator at your fingertips, while also accessing a powerful learning tool at the same time?
            </p>
            <p>With the excessive use of technology, our brains have become far removed from the important skill of being able to quickly and accurately compute simple math problems in our heads.  
                Children and adults have all fallen vulnerable to this skill degradation pattern.  
                Perhaps you felt yourself hesitate when attempting to calculate what your portion of the bill is at a lunch with friends.  
                Perhaps your children are struggling to count money during that unit in elementary school.  
                We have all been there!
            </p>
            <p>It is time to take advantage of the Multiple Choice Calculator and reaping all of the benefits that it has to offer!  
                Kids have so much fun using it to solve arithmetic problems, but since they still need to use and  their own math skills see the right answer, they have a much higher sense of accomplishment and learn so much more than when using a traditional calculator.  
                Adults have been reporting success stories about how they have regained their mental sharpness by simply using the Multiple Choice Calculator when they would normally use a traditional calculator.
            </p>
            <p>Since this Multiple Choice Calculator Web App utilizes the multiple choice format to teach and reinforce skills, it is not as daunting as other math skill enhancers on the market.  
                Parents do not feel like they are dooming their children to grueling math tutoring apps.  
                The Multiple Choice Calculator is simple to use and can just take the place of a traditional calculator, which means that it will not be intrusive to anyone’s lifestyle or time.  
                It is also functional, since it does actually calculate the arithmetic problems for you.
            </p>
            <p>Are you not in the mood, or in too much of a hurry to use Multiple Choice Calculator during critical times?  
                Do not worry, our app also provides a standard calculator that you are free to use.

            “I cannot live without my Multiple Choice Calculator!  
            I am a cashier at a fast-food restaurant, and there are times when a customer changes the amount of cash that they give me after I already entered the amount on my cash register screen.  
            I have to be able to make the correct change on the fly, my customers depend on that.  
            After I started using the Multiple Choice Calculator, both my speed and my accuracy making change in my head went way up!  
            I even got a raise since I am able to serve my customers so quickly!”
